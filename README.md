# Netflix Games Choose Your Own Adventure Game

An interactive text-based adventure game that generates unique stories based on user input themes using Google Gemini. The game creates rich narratives with branching paths, character interactions, and consequences for player choices. Available in both CLI and web interface versions (web version currently in beta).

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Google Gemini API key
- Required libraries: plotly, networkx, ipywidgets (for visualization)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd game-creation
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your Google API key:
   - Create a `keys.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your API key: `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here`

### Running the Game

#### CLI Version (Recommended)
```bash
python3 game.py
```

#### Web Version (Beta)
```bash
cd web_ui
python3 app.py
```
Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

> **Note:** The web version is currently in beta and will have limited functionality compared to the CLI version.

### Story Visualization

The project includes a Jupyter notebook for visualizing story graphs generated by the game:

1. Install additional visualization requirements:
```bash
pip install plotly networkx ipywidgets jupyter
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open `visualizer.ipynb` and run the cells to create interactive story visualizations:
   - View the full story graph structure
   - Track visited nodes (highlighted in green)
   - See detailed node information on hover (characters, outcomes, etc.)
   - Analyze branching paths and decision points

   **Important:** In the last code cell of the notebook, make sure to use the correct JSON filename after you drag the generated json generated by `game.py` into the visuals folder:
   ```python
   # Change this line to use your desired story JSON file
   story_data = load_story_json("your_story_file.json")  # e.g., "star_wars_story.json"
   ```
   

## Project Structure

### Core Components

#### CLI Version
- `game_clean.py` - Main game loop and CLI interface
- `storygen.py` - Story generation using Gemini AI
- `arc.py` - Story arc management and progression
- `Graph_Classes/` - Core game mechanics classes

#### Web Version
- `web_ui/app.py` - Flask web application
- `web_ui/webarc.py` - Web-specific story arc handling
- `web_ui/templates/` - HTML templates
- `web_ui/static/` - CSS, JavaScript, and static assets

#### Visualization
- `visualizer.ipynb` - Interactive Jupyter notebook for story graph visualization using Plotly
- Story JSON files for visualization (e.g., `stranger_things_story.json`)

## Gameplay

1. Start the game (CLI or web version)
2. Enter your name
3. Choose a story theme (e.g., "Star Wars", "Dracula", "Fantasy")
4. Navigate through the story by selecting choices
5. Manage health and inventory
6. Reach different endings based on choices

## Save System

The game automatically saves progress after each choice. Progress is automatically loaded when returning to a previous session (beta).

## Story Visualization Example

The visualizer creates interactive graphs with the following features:
- Nodes represent scenes in the story
- Edges show connections between scenes
- Green nodes indicate visited scenes
- Orange highlights the current scene
- Hover over nodes to see scene details:
  - Location and time information
  - Character status and moods
  - Health and inventory changes
  - Story text preview

**Note:** The last line in the notebook sets the story theme/title displayed at the top of the visualization:
```python
visualize_story(story_data, "Lord of the Rings Story")  # Change the title to match your story theme
```
