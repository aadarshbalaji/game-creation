        "story": "The wind howls across the craggy peaks of Tython, whipping at your Jedi robes. Here, at the ancient heart of the Jedi Order, the Force sings a powerful, constant song. But lately, the melody has soured. For weeks, disturbing visions have plagued your sleep \u2013 glimpses of a shattered Jedi Temple, the glow of crimson lightsabers, and a darkness that devours all light. The Jedi Masters, their faces etched with concern, dismiss them as mere stress, the byproduct of a Republic teetering on the brink of war with the Separatist Alliance. You, a promising Jedi Knight of [Choose Species: Human, Twi'lek, Zabrak, etc.] lineage, trained in the [Choose Fighting Style: Guardian, Sentinel, Consular] specialization, try to heed their counsel. You meditate, spar with fellow Knights, and immerse yourself in the study of the Force. But the visions persist, growing stronger, more vivid. Then, the unthinkable happens. The rhythmic hum of the Force is abruptly shattered by the thunderous roar of engines and the staccato fire of blaster cannons. Separatist warships pierce the atmosphere, their shadows falling upon the Jedi Temple. This isn\u2019t a skirmish; this is a coordinated assault. As you ignite your lightsaber, its [Choose Lightsaber Color] blade crackling to life, you charge into the fray. During the chaotic battle, you witness something that chills you to the bone: Master Vrook, a respected member of the Jedi Council, seemingly coordinating with Separatist droids, his face masked with an unnerving calm. Doubt gnaws at you. Could a Jedi Master betray the Order? Amidst the chaos and destruction, you know one thing: the visions were not a dream. Something terrible is about to happen, and you are at the epicenter.",
