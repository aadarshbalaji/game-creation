Sensei Wu, his eyes twinkling with pride, begins his address, recounting the brave deeds of his students. Suddenly, the air crackles with dark energy.

A dark energy blast sends the Sensei crashing to the ground. Chaos erupts as the attacker vanishes into the swirling smoke. You rush to Sensei Wu's side. His breaths are shallow, and his voice raspy. \"The Dragon Eye\u2026 the Obsidian Dragon\u2026 you must\u2026 stop them\u2026\" He clutches your hand, his gaze intense. \"You are the sixth\u2026 the last hope\u2026 Find the thief\u2026 before Ninjago is consumed by darkness\u2026\"",
