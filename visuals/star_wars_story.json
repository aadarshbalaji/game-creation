Assigned to the Ryloth sector \u2013 a dusty, backwater world teeming with smugglers and Separatist holdouts \u2013 you're tasked with maintaining order, a noble goal in the eyes of the Empire.\n\nSuddenly, a jarring jolt throws you against your harness. Alarms blare, bathing the cockpit in a harsh red light. On your scanner, a swarm of contacts erupts \u2013 too many to count, and definitely not Imperial. They're fast, heavily armed, and bearing down on you and your wingmates like hungry predators. A desperate comm crackle from Gamma Squadron confirms your worst fears: Crimson Dawn. The notorious crime syndicate, emboldened by chaos and armed with scavenged tech, has set a trap. Green laser fire streaks past your viewport, followed by the sickening explosion of your wingmate's TIE. You're alone now, caught in the crosshairs of a ruthless ambush.
