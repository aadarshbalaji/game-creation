You are Elara, a newly appointed Ranger of the North, and tonight, the silence of the Eriadorian wilderness feels heavy, pregnant with an unspoken dread. For weeks, you've patrolled these lands, a silent guardian against shadows creeping out of the East. Tonight, however, the shadows feel closer, more tangible. A twig snaps nearby, not with the skittishness of a wild creature, but with the heavy, deliberate tread of\u2026 someone. A figure stumbles out of the darkness, barely upright. He's an Elf, his silver hair matted with mud and blood, his elven cloak torn to shreds. His eyes, wide with terror, fix on you. He rasps, a desperate whisper against the wind, \"Shadows\u2026 whispering shadows\u2026 Mirkwood\u2026 foul presence\u2026 the Weaver\u2026\" He coughs, a bloody froth bubbling on his lips. He tries to speak again, but his strength fails. His body slumps forward, lifeless, at your feet. The only sound now is the relentless roar of the Bruinen, and the nagging feeling that a darkness you thought long defeated is stirring once more.",
