A chill wind whispers through the crumbling stones of Carfax Abbey, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and something else\u2026 something metallic and unsettling. You, a freshly graduated physician eager to make a name for yourself, arrive at Dr. Seward\u2019s sanatorium on the outskirts of Purfleet. The air is thick with a palpable tension, a stark contrast to the sterile environment of your medical school. Patients wander the grounds, their eyes wide with fear, muttering about shadows and whispers in the night. Seward himself, a man etched with weariness, greets you with a strained smile. He welcomes you as his newest assistant, unaware you may soon be the sanatorium's last. Only moments later, a patient, a gaunt man with haunted eyes, thrusts a crumpled note into your hand. It reads: *'He is back. The tall man with the red eyes. He walks near the Abbey. Beware\u2026'*. A tremor runs through you. Is this the ramblings of a madman, or a warning of something far more sinister? A sudden howl pierces the night, a sound that seems to emanate from the very stones of Carfax Abbey, amplifying the warning in your ears.",
