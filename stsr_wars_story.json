        "story": "The reek of burnt spice and cheap engine lubricant hung thick in the air, a constant companion in the grimy alleys of Nar Shaddaa. Scraps of discarded metal crunched under Jara's worn boots as she wrestled a stubborn access panel free from the belly of a battered freighter. The 'Rusty Bucket,' as she'd affectionately nicknamed it, was a Corellian Engineering Corporation YT-1300f light freighter \u2013 ancient, heavily modified, and currently spewing more smoke than exhaust. Sweat plastered strands of auburn hair to her forehead as she peered into the freighter's guts, the flickering neon sign of 'Gorak's Garage: We Fix Anything (Maybe)' casting long, dancing shadows. \n\n'Jara! Kriff, are you almost done with that rust bucket?' Uncle Gorak's voice boomed from inside the garage, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of a hammer against durasteel. 'Zitto's breathing down my neck! He wants that freighter operational before sunsdown or we're sleeping in the scrap heaps tonight!'\n\nJara muttered under her breath, tightening her grip on the thermal detonator wrench. Zitto. The very mention of the Hutt enforcer made her stomach churn. Every month it was the same \u2013 Gorak groveling, Jara working herself to the bone, all to keep the Hutts from taking what little they had. \n\nIgnoring her uncle's increasingly frantic calls, Jara continued her work, tracing a frayed power cable. That's when she saw it. Tucked away behind a loose conduit, almost perfectly concealed, was a small, rectangular compartment. Curiosity overriding caution, she pried it open. Inside, nestled in a layer of faded cloth, was a datapad. Its screen was cracked, and the casing was scorched, but the faint hum of power still resonated from within. Intrigued, she carefully extracted it, a flicker of hope igniting within her that this might be something, anything, more than another day of grease and Hutt oppression. A fragment of a message flickered onto the cracked screen: '...Omega Protocol\u2026Rakata Prime\u2026must\u2026' The message abruptly cut off, replaced by static. The gears of adventure, she suspected, had just begun to turn.",

        "story": "Jara stared at the flickering datapad screen, the words 'Omega Protocol' and 'Rakata Prime' burned into her mind. Rakata Prime\u2026 she\u2019d heard whispers of that name in the cantinas \u2013 a mythic world, home to a powerful, vanished civilization. The datapad itself was warm in her hands, pulsing with a latent energy that sent a shiver down her spine. Uncle Gorak shambled over, wiping grease from his hands with a rag. He squinted at the datapad, his brow furrowed in confusion.\n\nSuddenly, the cracked screen flared to life, displaying a holographic image \u2013 a woman with kind eyes and the robes of a Jedi. Her image was fragmented, flickering in and out of existence.\n\n[Jedi Master Lyra (hologram)] \"\u2026if you are seeing this, it means the worst has come to pass.

He backed away, his eyes wide with fear.\n\n[Uncle Gorak]: \"Jara, kriff that! Jedi? Hutts? Sith? That's a one-way ticket to a blaster bolt in the back! You leave that alone!\"",
