Years of scavenging have honed your mechanical skills and instincts for survival under the oppressive Imperial occupation. The Empire's presence is a constant weight, crushing the Twi'lek people under its boot. You're mostly concerned with keeping your head down and finding enough scrap to trade for food and fuel, until a broken datapad catches your eye. It flickers with a faint, distorted image and a garbled message - a plea for help from a hidden Rebel cell on the brink of annihilation. Something about the message resonates deep within you, stirring long-dormant feelings of resistance and a sense of destiny you can't quite explain.",
