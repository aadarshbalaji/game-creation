Just weeks ago, you and the Ninja \u2013 Kai, Jay, Zane, Cole, Lloyd, and Nya \u2013 were celebrating another victory, enjoying the peace that rarely lasts. But as you relax at the docks, a monstrous sandstorm erupts from the horizon. It's unlike anything you've ever seen, a swirling vortex of ochre that swallows the sky. The air vibrates with a low, guttural hum, and whispers carried on the wind speak of a name long forgotten: Apophis, the Eater of Worlds. The storm intensifies, burying everything in its path. You struggle to stand, sand blasting against your face as a glint of gold catches your eye. It's a crumbling mural, unearthed by the storm, depicting a serpentine deity consuming everything in its path. This is no ordinary sandstorm. It's a harbinger. The Ninja gather, faces grim. Lloyd, ever the leader, points towards the Shifting Sands Desert. \"The storm's source...it's coming from an ancient ruin, buried deep within.

Armed with repurposed weapons and a stroke of ingenuity, the ninja confronted Apophis, utilizing the Bounty\u2019s navigational tools to disrupt his elemental balance and weaken him.

The decision to sacrifice one of the Ninja to a dream realm and their personal fears sealed away the Eater of Worlds forever, but the Bounty, damaged beyond repair and no one on board to repair it, crashes into the sands, now a tomb for the sacrificed hero.",
