The rebuilt Monastery of Spinjitzu, perched high in the clouds above Jamanakai Village, stands as a testament to that peace. Here, the legendary ninja \u2013 Lloyd, Kai, Jay, Cole, Zane, and Nya \u2013 train a new generation, shaping protectors from potential. You are one of these initiates, eager to prove your worth, to master your elemental potential. Days are filled with grueling training regimens, sparring sessions that leave you bruised but exhilarated, and lectures on the history of Ninjago, tales of heroes and villains, of balance and destruction. Today is no different, or so you thought. Master Lloyd, green energy crackling around his hands, leads your group through a particularly challenging obstacle course designed to test your agility and focus. As you navigate a series of precarious platforms and elemental barriers, something strange occurs. When you touch a seemingly innocuous stone, a surge of energy courses through you, unlike anything you\u2019ve ever experienced. Images flash before your eyes \u2013 swirling colours, fragmented landscapes, and a feeling of immense power, both terrifying and intoxicating. You stumble back, clutching your head as the vision subsides. The stone glows faintly, an echo of the energy that now thrums within you. Master Lloyd approaches, his expression a mixture of concern and curiosity. \u201cWhat happened? Are you alright?\u201d he asks, his voice laced with genuine worry.",
